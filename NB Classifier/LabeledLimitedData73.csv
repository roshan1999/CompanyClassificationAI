DTDs can reside in acentral repository and can even be combined to make larger DTDs by choosingmodular sections. The following subsections describe how DTDs can be accessed in XML documentsor in the DTDs that define them. Pointing to an External DTD Non-local external DTDs can be pointed to using the DOCTYPEdeclaration like this if the DTD is on the Web: <!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC ""-//LeeAnne.com//Article DTD//EN"" ""http://www.leeanne.com/XML/article.dtd""> Or, a series of DTD fragments can be pointed to using parameter entityreferences like this: <!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC ""-//LeeAnne.com//Article DTD//EN"" ""http://www.leeanne.com/XML/article.dtd""> [<!ENTITY % header PUBLIC ""-//LeeAnne.com//Header DTD//EN"" ""http://www.leeanne.com/XML/header.dtd"">>%header;<!ENTITY % footer PUBLIC ""-//LeeAnne.com//Footer DTD//EN"" ""http://www.leeanne.com/XML/footer.dtd"">>%footer;...]> This mechanism is widely used to call in files of character entity referencesbut can also be used for other purposes. Be aware, however, that non-validatingprocessors are forbidden to interpret any parsed entity following an externalparameter entity reference it doesn't read. The reason is that the state of every parsed entity is undefined after anyexternal reference not incorporated into the document. In fact, it's legalfor a non-validating processor to ignore external entities entirely. Pointing to a Local DTD Although a local DTD is also an external DTD, there is a slightly differentsyntax used to reference local DTDs because one doesn't ordinarily includea catalog reference. Local DTDs can be pointed to using the DOCTYPEdeclaration like this if the DTD is on your local hard drive: <!DOCTYPE article SYSTEM ""article.dtd""> A series of DTD fragments can be pointed to using parameter entity referenceslike this: <!DOCTYPE article SYSTEM ""article.dtd""> [<!ENTITY % header SYSTEM ""header.dtd"">>%header;<!ENTITY % footer SYSTEM ""footer.dtd"">>%footer;...]> This mechanism is widely used to call in files of character entity referencesbut can also be used for other purposes. Be aware, however, that non-validatingprocessors are not allowed to interpret any parsed entity following an externalparameter entity reference, including a DTD, it doesn't read. The reason for this is that the state of every parsed entity is undefinedafter any external reference not incorporated into the document because a valuemight or might not have been set for it in the unread external entity. Anon-validating parser has no way of knowing one way or another. In fact,it's legal for a non-validating processor to ignore external entitiesentirely.  TIP Why do we bother with non-validating processors anyway? Wouldn't it bebetter to validate everything? In a word, no. Imagine how difficult itwould be to load a page if browsers required every link to be traversed andverified before it would highlight a hyperlink. XML browsers cantransclude, include as actual content, documents from anywhere on theWeb. So you have no control over how pages are structured. If a page youtransclude includes extensive and recursive access to other pages or DTDs, youmay have a long wait before the page loads. XML browsers are likely to mark theplace where an external reference is made and let the user choose whether toload it, much as the user has control over taking a hyperlink.  It's likely that most actual user agents (browsers) used on the Web arenon-validating. The potential overhead of validation, visiting every referencedlocation, is so great that the most sensible plan for any browser is to wait tovisit external documents until requested to do so by the user. Using DTD Fragments The preceding two examples both used DTD fragments to extend the article DTD.If you think of a document as a tree, then a DTD fragment is a way to graft onanother limb to the tree. The DTD must be structured in a way that this can bedone with careful attention to namespaces until the XML namespace initiativecomes to fruition. The most common use of DTD fragments is to reference the long lists ofgeneral entities used to refer to character entities by mnemonic name. So youcan use the more understandable &lsquo; instead of&#8216; when referring to a left single quotation mark. Few peoplehave memorized the table of ISO and Unicode character by number. It's justtoo hard for most people. The easiest way to use the mnemonics is to call in apredefined set of them by name. There are a lot of these, of course, but theordinary ones you'll see are Latin-1, Special Symbols, and Mathematics andGreek Symbols. Here's how to point to Latin-1 for XHTML: <!ENTITY % ISOlat1 PUBLIC ""-//W3C//ENTITIES Latin1//EN//XML""         ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/HTMLlat1x.ent"">%ISOlat1; The one we just looked at is defined as <!ENTITY lsquo  ""&#8216;""> <!-- left single quotation mark, U+2018  ISOnum --> inside the special characters set and invoked like this: <!ENTITY % HTMLspecial PUBLIC ""-//W3C//ENTITIES Special//EN//HTML""    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/HTMLspecialx.ent"">%HTMLspecial; If you're going to do any math at all you might need this one aswell: <!ENTITY % HTMLsymbol PUBLIC ""-//W3C//ENTITIES Symbols//EN//HTML""    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/HTMLsymbolx.ent"">%HTMLsymbol;which contains things like <!ENTITY cong   ""&#8773;""> <!--  approximately equal to, U+2245 ISOtech --><!ENTITY asymp  ""&#8776;""> <!-- almost equal to = asymptotic to,  U+2248 ISOamsr --><!ENTITY ne    ""&#8800;""> <!-- not equal to, U+2260 ISOtech --><!ENTITY equiv  ""&#8801;""> <!-- identical to, U+2261 ISOtech --><!ENTITY le    ""&#8804;""> <!-- less-than or equal to, U+2264 ISOtech --><!ENTITY ge    ""&#8805;""> <!-- greater-than or equal to, U+2265 ISOtech --><!ENTITY sub   ""&#8834;""> <!-- subset of, U+2282 ISOtech --><!ENTITY sup   ""&#8835;""> <!-- superset of, U+2283 ISOtech --> These symbols are commonly used in mathematics and scientific fields. Thissymbol set also contains Greek letters and other goodies to make it easier totype simple mathematics into your pages. A good way to allow easy use of modular DTDs is to provide stubs within thedocument, which can be used to expand on DTD capabilities when needed andignored As an example, a DTD might start out with some entities that point to nullfiles like this: <!ENTITY % header SYSTEM ""nullfile.dtd"">>%header;<!ENTITY % footer SYSTEM ""nullfile.dtd"">>%footer;...]> When you wanted to actually use the header and footer information youcould override these values with ones that actually do something like this:  <!DOCTYPE article SYSTEM ""article.dtd""> [<!ENTITY % header SYSTEM ""header.dtd"">><!ENTITY % footer SYSTEM ""footer.dtd"">> ...]> In the next chapter, you'll explore another way to insert new tags, orentire branches Parameter Entities A parameter entity is a way to store data (or point to it for laterretrieval) for later use. Parameter entities are valid only within a DTD andhave different behaviors in the internal subset of the DTD and the externalsubset. This asymmetric behavior was decided upon to make it easier to parse aninternal DTD for a non-validating XML processor.   NOTE After spending so much time clarifying the different ways in which you canuse parameter entities to make life easy, it's somewhat ironic that most ofthe XML schema proposals pretty much scrap parameter entities in favor of anXML-like, as opposed to DTD-like, syntax. And so it goes....  You can put any number of things into a parameter entity and use them at yourconvenience. A typical use is to read in external files within a DTD, either inthe external or internal subset. Another common use is to store integral bits ofmarkup parts so that they can be used in a mnemonic way as shorthand for complexexpressions. For bits of markup that are used over and over again, the gain inclarity can be enormous. You may want to refer to Chapter 4, ""Extending a Document TypeDefinition with Local Modifications,"" for a complete example of workingwith and around parameter entities. The following expands an element definedusing parameter entities because a a copy of it was made in the internal DTDsubset: <!ELEMENT blink %Flow;><!ATTLIST blink %attrs;> The previous code, with two parameter entities in two locations, expandedthrough a series of indirection to this: <!ELEMENT blink (#PCDATA | p | h1 | h2 | h3 | h4 | h5 | h6 | div | ul | ol | dl | menu | dir | pre | hr | blockquote | address | center | noframes | isindex | fieldset | table | form | a | br | span | bdo | object | applet | img | map | iframe | tt | i | b | big | small | u | s | strike |font | basefont | em | strong | dfn | code | q | sub | sup | samp | kbd | var | cite | abbr | acronym | input | select | textarea | label | button | ins | del | script | noscript)* ><!ATTLIST blink id     ID       #IMPLIED class    CDATA     #IMPLIED style    CDATA     #IMPLIED title    CDATA     #IMPLIED lang    NMTOKEN    #IMPLIED xml:lang  NMTOKEN    #IMPLIED dir     (ltr|rtl)   #IMPLIED onclick   CDATA     #IMPLIED ondblclick CDATA     #IMPLIED onmousedown CDATA     #IMPLIED onmouseup  CDATA     #IMPLIED onmouseover CDATA     #IMPLIED onmousemove CDATA     #IMPLIED onmouseout CDATA     #IMPLIED onkeypress CDATA     #IMPLIED onkeydown  CDATA     #IMPLIED onkeyup   CDATA     #IMPLIED> This expansion is obviously somewhat harder to read than the parameter entityequivalent, especially if the construct is used in many locations. Understanding the W3C Entity Table Table 3.2 explains where everything can go in a nutshell. Although it reallyisn't all that clear, a similar table is used in the W3C XML 1.0Recommendation to attempt to clarify the rules that entities obey in variouscontexts and is reproduced or paraphrased almost everywhere: Table 3.2 XML 1.0 Entity Type Behaviors     Entity Type   Parameter   Internal General   External Parsed General   Unparsed   Character       Reference in Content   Not recognized   Included   Included if validating   Forbidden   Included      Reference in Attribute Value   Not recognized   Included in literal   Forbidden   Forbidden   Included      Occurs as Attribute Value   Not recognized   Forbidden   Forbidden   Notify   Not recognized       Reference in Entity Value   Included in literal   Bypassed   Bypassed   Forbidden   Included      Reference in DTD   Included as PE   Forbidden   Forbidden   Forbidden   Forbidden     Let's try to clarify this blob of information. The firstrow of the table refers to locations in the document itself. The second andthird rows refer to locations in either the document or its DTD. The final tworows refer to locations in the DTD only. The table starts to make sense onlywhen you realize that the information content depicted is sparse. There arequite a number of entries that tell you only that a given entity type can onlyappear in one location. I question whether the table is all that valuable,although people will duplicate or paraphrase it. In the actual XML 1.0Recommendation, almost all the real information about the table lies in the textthat references it. Let's list the few bits of information the table contains in sevensimplified rules:  Parameter entities can be used only in the DTD. Outside the DTD, theircalling sequence, %name;, is treated as plain text.  Inside a declaration, parameter entities are expanded but only in theexternal subset. Outside of a declaration, parameter entities can only be used to insertcomplete markup declarations and surround all insertions with a leading andtrailing space. Internal general entities can only be used to insert text and arebypassed in the DTD. Bypassed means that they are recognized and theirname is entered into a lookup table with no current value. When they aredeclared, the lookup entry has a value associated with it. It's an obscureway of saying you can use them before they are declared. External parsed general entities are treated just like internal generalentities except that you can't refer to them in an attribute value. This ison account of the difficulty of  handling character encodings in the context ofan attribute. Unparsed entities can only be used as a name in an entity declaration.Nothing else is recognized in that context, including character entities. Theonly responsibility of the XML processor is to notify the helper applicationdeclared in a notation declaration that the unparsed entity needsprocessing. Character entities are treated like general entities except that they areincluded immediately in all cases. Although they are universal, in most casesthey should be used as general entities from one of the predefined sets. The rawnumeric references, although legal, are almost impossible to read andunderstand. So, the mnemonic &ne; is easier to identify than thedecidedly hard to remember &#8800; equivalent, although both referto the ""not equal to"" (≠) symbol.  Parameter entities are so powerful, in fact, that the XML 1.0 standard takescare to curb their power by restricting them first to the DTD and then furtherrestricting the most complex uses to the external subset of the DTD, wherenon-validating XML processors never (well, rarely) look.  TIP If you're using parameter entities to store text, be aware that XMLprocessors insert one leading and one trailing space when expanding them. Thisis to discourage people from using them to store small pieces of text andbuilding words (or especially markup!) out of them.  The need for parameter entities probably will eventually disappear when oneor more of the XML schema proposals gains market share in the minds of users.But this will be a while as the dueling standards have a lot to reconcileyet.    < Back Page 8 of 10 Next >      + Share This    🔖 Save To Your Account            Related Resources  Store Articles Blogs   There are currently no related titles.

His mother was from rural northern Peru while his father grew up closer to large Peruvian cities.[3] He began rapping at age 12 and later started making beats and writing songs with a friend at the Museum of Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2010, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a songwriter and producer.[1]  Career[edit] A.CHAL released his debut EP, Ballroom Riots, in 2013. The album found some success, which he parlayed into a publishing deal with Sony ATV.[1][3] He then spent two years out of the public spotlight before beginning to release a variety of singles in 2015.[1][5] One of those singles, ""Round Whippin'"", was debuted online on The Fader and then followed up with a world premiere on Zane Lowe's Beats1 channel and supported on OVO Sound Radio.[5][6][8] As a result of this publicity, A.CHAL was named one of Pigeons & Planes best new artists of 2015.[7] He also performed at the Interview Magazine event during Coachella that year.[1][2] In February 2015, he released the single ""GAZI"", which he co-produced with Count Justice.[1] In September 2015, A.CHAL released another a single, ""Vibe W/U"", which was first publicized by A$AP Rocky on Twitter.[5][6][8] In 2016, A.CHAL performed at the Day N Nite Fest.[4] He also released a few more singles before self-releasing his debut studio album, Welcome to GAZI, in June 2016.[3][6] He has since premiered the official music video for ""Round Whippin'"" with Complex.com[9] and been featured on tracks by Ro James,[10] Stwo,[11] and Tess.[12] In March 2018, A.CHAL signed with Epic Records.[13]  Musical style[edit] A.CHAL's music generally fits into the hip hop and R&B genres. USA Today has described his music as falling somewhere ""in the negative space between Hip-Hop, R&B, chillwave, and pop music.""[8] A.CHAL himself has described his music's genre as soul.[3] His sound has also been characterized as ""sedated"", ""hazy"", and ""almost-psychedelic"".[1][7][14] Remezcla has called his voice ""sultry, sparse, and desperate"".[1] Lyrically, he largely discusses anecdotal experiences. Writing about his 2016 album Welcome to GAZI, Jules Muir of Pigeons & Planes noted that A.CHAL attempts to cut ""to the core of many of society's ills and triumphs by tapping into a deep well of personal experiences and anecdotes.""[5]  Discography[edit] Studio albums[edit]  List of albums   Title  Details   Welcome to Gazi   Release: June 3, 2016 Label: GAZI World/Empire Format: Digital download, streaming   On Gaz   Release: June 2, 2017 Label: GAZI World/Empire Format: Digital download, streaming  EPs[edit] Ballroom Riots (2013) Exotigaz (2018) Singles[edit] As lead artist[edit]   Title  Year  Peak chart positions  Album   USR&BAirplay[15]  USLatinPop[16]  USRapAirplay[17]  USRhy.[18]   ""Round Whippin'""  2016  — — — —  Welcome to Gazi   ""To the Light""  2017  — — — —  On Gaz   ""Matrix""  — — — —   ""Love N Hennessy""(solo or featuring 2 Chainz and Nicky Jam)  50 — 24 20   ""Perdóname""  — — — —   ""Cuánto""(featuring A$AP Nast)  — — — —   ""000000""  2019  — 40 — 28  Exotigaz   ""—"" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.

This batch of 88 Letters Patent Appeals arise out of      judgment and order 17-4-2003 whereby the writ petitions preferred by a      large number of writ petitioners, all    untrained assistant teachers in      Elementary      Schools under the Government of Bihar having                                     301     qualification of Intermediate, Graduate or Post-graduate claiming scale  of trained matric teachers, were dismissed. The Judgment under appeal  passed in C.W.J.C. No. 8032 of 1999 (Arbind Kumar & others Vrs. The  State of Bihar and others) and other analogous writ petitions also  decides C.W.J.C. No. 10877 of 2002 from which L.P.A. No. 412 of  2003 has arisen and that has been argued as the leading case. In this  appeal there are altogether 70 appellants. The facts, wherever necessary  have been taken from the records of this appeal.  2.          Before considering the appeals on merit it needs to be noted  that facts are not in dispute and the basic issue is whether claim of the  appellant for grant of matric trained scale is sustainable in the teeth of  provisions in the Bihar Elementary School Appointment Rules framed  under Article 309 of the Constitution of India for appointment on the  post of teachers in elementary schools which were published in Bihar  Gazette dated 1st October,1991 although the notification of the Human  Resources Development Department is dated 30th September, 1991 ( for  the sake of brevity, hereinafter described as the Rules). As noticed  above, although the main controversy relates to giving matric trained  scale to the teachers of the elementary schools having higher  qualification but not possessing a certificate in teachers training, the  appellants through the batch of writ applications in question also sought  quashing of an order dated 16-1-2001 issued by the Deputy Secretary,  Finance Department, Government of Bihar whereby they were denied  the scale of pay of matric trained teachers on the ground that teachers  training is a requisite qualification for grant of matric trained scale and                                        302     excess payment made to the teachers on account of earlier order of the  authorities granting them matric trained scale was ordered to be  recovered in 20 equal installments.  3.        Initially the writ petitions were disposed of by a learned single  Judge by judgment and order dated 14-9-2001 with a direction to the  State Government to issue necessary notification to implement the  recommendations of the Fitment Appellate Committee ( For brevity  F.A.C.) in respect of elementary school teachers on the point in issue.  Relief was granted to Graduate and Post-graduate untrained teachers  only and not to Intermediate untrained teachers because there was no  recommendation of F.A.C. in favour of the latter. The authorities were  further directed not to make any recovery. The learned single Judge also  directed the State Government to hold special examination for those  teachers who had undergone training while in service.  4.                The aforesaid judgment of learned Single Judge dated  14-9-2001 was challenged by Prathmik Adhyapak Sangh and some  Intermediate untrained teachers through Letters Patent Appeals which  were allowed on 16-4-2002 by a judgment of the Division Bench in the  case of Prathmik Adhyapak Sangh Vrs. The State of Bihar, reported in  2003 (2) PLJR 305. Those appeals were allowed not on consideration of  the matter on merits but only on the principle of likelihood of bias  because the learned single Judge who had heard the writ petition with  consent of the parties had also dealt with the matter as Chairman of the  F.A.C. As a result, the writ petitions were directed to be heard afresh by                                      303     another learned single Judge and after fresh hearing were dismissed by  the judgment and order under appeal.  5.      It is not in dispute that earlier to 1991 i.e., before the Rules were  framed for appointment to the post of teachers in the elementary schools,  the minimum qualification was matriculation and a certificate of basic  teachers training of two years duration. However, even the untrained  teachers were appointed in certain subjects on the plea of non-  availability of trained teachers and due to relaxation in the case of lady  candidates and candidates belonging to the minority community.  Admittedly large number of untrained teachers having higher  qualification than matriculation had been appointed prior to 1991 in the  matric trained scale whereas the other scale was of matric untrained.  6.              On considering reports of Fitment Committee of 1989  constituted by the State Government and also the report of Anomaly  Removal Committee, the State Government issued a notification on  18-12-1989 and teachers of the elementary schools were placed in two  categories. One was of matric untrained teachers in the scale of Rs.975-  1540 and the other consisted of matric trained, Intermediate trained,  Intermediate untrained and Graduation untrained, placed in matric  trained scale of Rs.1200-2040.  7.       By a policy decision dated 5-3-1991 the requirement of teachers  training for appointment as assistant teachers for elementary schools was  dispensed with and instead provision was made for in-service training  and in that light the Bihar Elementary Schools Teachers Appointment  Rules i.e. the Rules were framed on 8-10-1991.             Pursuant to an                                           304     advertisement dated 8-10-1991 about 25 thousand teachers were  appointed under the Rules. The writ petitioners being untrained were  appointed in the year 1994 in matric untrained scales of Rs.975/- 1540/-  8.       At this stage it is relevant to notice Rule 11 of the Rules which  provides for appointment and prescribes the scale of pay and reads as  follows :-       ^^11- ojh;rk lwph ls vkj{k.k fu;eksa dk vuqikyu djrs gq, fjfDr;ksa dks Hkjus      ds fy, fuEu izdkj dkjZokbZ dh tk;xh &      ¼1½ tks mEehnokj izf""kf{kr gS mUgsa eSfV~zd izf""kf{kr osrueku esa fu;qDr fd;k      tk;xk A      ¼2½ tks mEehnokj vizf""kf{kr gSa mUgsa eSfV~zd vizf""kf{kr osrueku ds izkjfEHkd      osrueku esa fuEu ""krksZ ds lkFk fu;qDr fd;k tk;sxk %&      ¼d½ izf""k{k.k ds fy, izfrfu;qDr fd;s tkus ij mlesa i;kZIr dkj.k ds Hkkx u      ysus ij lsok lekIr dj nh tk;sxh A      ¼[k½ izf""k{k.k mijkUr ijh{kk yh tk;sxh mlesa mEehnokj ;fn lQy ugha gksrk      gS rks mls ,d ekSdk vkSj fn;k tk;sxk ;fn nwljh ckj Hkh og vuqRrh.kZ jgrk gS      rks mldh lsok lekIr dj nh tk;sxh A      ¼x½ izf""k{k.k dh vOF/k esa le;&le; ij fu/kkZfjr nj ij o`frdk ek= ns;      gksxh A izf""k{k.k vOF/k ds fy, osru ns; ugha gksxk A      ¼?k½ dafMdk ^^[k** esa fufnZ'V ijh{kk esa mRrh.kZ gksus ds mijkUr eSfV~zd izf""kf{kr      osrueku fn;k tk;sxk A ** 9.       The Rules stipulate for a written examination and on the basis of  marks obtained therein and in the light of Rules for reservation,  preparation of a seniority list ( select list ) in accordance with the  provisions in Rules 10 of the Rules. Rule 11 mandates to fill up the  vacancy from the seniority list with due compliance of rules for  reservation and to appoint ( i ) trained candidates in matric trained scale,  (ii) untrained candidates in matric untrained scales. While directing to  appoint untrained teachers in the initial scale of matric untrained scales  the following conditions have also been prescribed for the untrained  appointees as per sub-rule (2) of Rule 11:- (a ) Their services will be  terminated if without sufficient reasons they do not participate in the  training when required to do so. (b) after training an examination shall                                      305     be held and those candidates who fail therein will be afforded another  opportunity, but if they will fail again then their services will be  terminated, (c) during the period of training the appointees shall be paid  only a stipend at the prescribed rate. No salary shall be payable for the  training period (d ) after passing the examination mentioned in ( b )  matric trained scale shall be granted.  10.          In the judgment of the Division Bench dated 16-4-2002  reported in 2003 (2) PLJR,305 ( Prathmik Adhyapak Sangh Vrs. The  State of Bihar) it is mentioned that after appointment about 79%  teachers were sent for training. The decision of the State Government  to appoint even untrained teachers was challenged before this Court  unsuccessfully and S.L.P. No. 23187/98 preferred before the Apex Court  was disposed of on 5-9-1997. The same is reported in (1998) 9 SCC  227. The Apex Court did not interfere with the impugned decision of  the State Government but directed to take the required steps for training  of untrained teachers from October, 1997 so that all could get a chance  of getting duly trained within two years time. Though majority of  untrained teachers obtained training while in service but no examination  was held till May,2004, whereafter the result was published on 20th  June,2005. Only then the successful teachers have been allowed matric  trained scale. The dispute is mainly for the earlier period during which,  on account of different orders the writ petitioners claim to have received  their pay in that scale till 30.9.2003. Writ petitioners want that scale to  be formalized and extended till results of training in June,2005. State  insists on recovery of excess payment made till September, 2003. After                                       306     hearing had concluded, at the instance of State this matter was against  listed for clarification of aforesaid facts by both the parties.  11.           The two scales provided by the State Government in its  resolution dated 18-2-1989 though of the period prior to the notification  of the Rules in the 1991, fell for reconsideration due to general demand  of the State Government Employees and                for some reasons got  implemented in respect of writ petitioners also. A decision contained in  memo no. 999 dated 7-6-1995 issued under the signature of Director  (Primary Education), Govt. of Bihar discloses that the decision was  taken in the light of an agreement between the Government and some  Unions/Associations.      That decision did not make any distinction  between the teachers appointed under the earlier Rules and those  appointed in 1994 pursuant to the Rules of 1991. As a result the writ  petitioners got matric trained scale on account of their higher  qualification although they were not trained, with effect from the date of  their appointment.  12.    The controversy re-surfaced when State Government employees  raised a demand for grant of Central Pay Scales.                   The Finance  Department , Government of Bihar on 2-1-1998 constituted a Fitment  Committee to consider the issue relating to payment of scale etc.  admissible to the Central Government employees.                    The Fitment  Committee in its report in respect of teachers of elementary schools  noticed that teachers training was mandatory requirement for  appointment in a Central Government School and therefore the  committee recommended for two scales, one for matric trained teachers                                      307     and the other for untrained teachers irrespective of their qualification, as  was the provision in the Rules. The recommendations were accepted  with some modification leading to resolution dated 8-2-1999 whereby  the pay scales of the Government employees including the elementary  school teachers were revised with effect from 1-1-1996. The matric  trained teachers were provided with the scale of Rs.4500-7000/- and the  untrained teachers were granted the scale of Rs.3050-4590/-. Because  of such decision there was resentment amongst the affected untrained  teachers and that led the State Government to issue a circular dated 25-6-  1999, which provided that untrained teachers who had completed one  year in service training by 1-1-1996 but could not pass the examination  due to non-holding of examination shall be provisionally granted the  matric trained scale subject to the condition that they shall have to pass  the training examination whenever it was held next, otherwise, the  excess amount will be recovered from them.  13.         This notification was challenged by some teachers through  C.W.J.C. No. 7103/99 which was allowed and the notification dated 25-  6-99 was quashed by judgment and order dated 17-5-2000. Thereafter  the State Government issued an order dated 16-1-2000 adopting the  recommendation of Fitment Committee and reiterating its earlier  decision dated 8-2-99 to the effect that training was a condition  precedent for grant of matric trained scale and therefore untrained  teachers even with    higher qualification could not be given such scale  and the amount paid to them on account of such higher scale shall be  recovered in twenty equal installments. This decision dated 16-1-2001 is                                    308     basically under challenge in all the writ petitions from which the order  under appeal arises.  14.           It is relevant to note that during the pendency of C.W.J.C.  No. 7103 of 1999 the employees of the State Government in various  departments protested against the recommendations of the Fitment  Committee as well as the decision of the State Government in respect of  such recommendations leading to constitution of a Fitment Appellate  Committee (F.A.C.) by the State Government vide notification dated  15-1-2000. The same was presided over by a learned sitting judge of  this Court. It is also significant to note that prior to constitution of  F.A.C., there was an agreement between the Teachers Association and  the State Government dated 7-5-99 which is contained in annexure-10  and mentions that the dispute raised would be referred to F.A.C. and  recommendations of the same would be acceptable to both the parties.  15.          The recommendations of the F.A.C. in respect of untrained  graduate teachers of the elementary schools were for giving matric  trained scale notionally with effect from 1-1-1996 and effectively from  1-4-1997 but such benefit was not recommended for untrained teachers  having qualification of Intermediate but from them also excess amount  was not to be recovered. These recommendations have remained  pending with the Government without any decision one way or the other  which is largely because of lodging of writ cases and decisions by this  Court.  16.           On behalf of appellants it was highlighted that while the  recommendations of the F.A.C. could not be implemented in the State of                                    309     Bihar because the judgment and order dated 14-9-2001, passed in these  writ petitions for implementation of those recommendations was set  aside on a technical ground by judgment of a Division Bench dated 16-  4-2002, the State of Jharkhand which was created in the meantime,  implemented the recommendations of the F.A.C. in respect of  elementary schools through a decision contained in letter no. 4568 dated  5th July, 2002 issued by the Finance Department of the Government of  Jharkhand (Annexure 14 to the memo of appeal ). On the other hand,  the State of Bihar through letter dated 4-9-2002 issued by the Finance  Department reiterated its decision to recover excess payment of salary in  20 equal installments while adopting new pay-scales as recommended by  the Fitment Committee. The point sought to be made out on behalf of  appellants is that only because they remained in the State of Bihar they  are deprived of benefits of recommendations of the F.A.C. while such  benefits have been given to other similarly situated elementary school  teachers who got allocated to the newly created State of Jharkhand.  17.       A judgment of this court dated 12-9-2002 in C.W.J.C. No. 122  of 2001 ( Smt. Kumari Kalpana Rani Vrs. The State of Bihar and  others) has been enclosed as annexure-8 to show that in the said case an  untrained assistant teacher who had completed training course on 10-5-  99 made a prayer for a direction upon the State Government to hold  examination for the training course already completed and this Court  after noticing the observations and directions of the Apex Court in the  case of Ram Vijay Kumar and others Vrs. State of Bihar and others,  (1998 ) 9 SCC 227 directed the Government of Bihar to hold the                                    310     examination within a period of six months.      As noticed earlier the  examination was held much later in 2004 and result was published on  20.6.2005.  18.          On behalf of appellants Mr.Rajendra Prasad Singh, learned  Senior Advocate highlighted the fact that as per Government decision of  1989 dated 18-12-89 the State of Bihar recognized equivalence of work  of teaching by matric trained teachers and untrained teachers having  higher qualification of Intermediate or Graduation and therefore they  were allowed the same pay-scales but for no good reasons, on the plea of  examining equivalence for grant of Central pay-scale, appellants were  placed in lower pay-scale as compared to a matric trained teacher. Thus  an effort was made to convince this court to interfere on the ground of  arbitrariness and unfairness in the impugned decision. Secondly, by  reference to higher pay-scale of matric trained or untrained graduate  teachers in the State of Jharkhand, again an attempt was made to indict  the impugned action    of the State of Bihar as unfair and arbitrary.  Thirdly, it was submitted that in view of written agreement between the  Association representing the appellant teachers and the State of Bihar  that both the parties shall accept the decision of the F.A.C., the State  Government should not be permitted to back out from the agreement by  not accepting the recommendations of the F.A.C. In support of this plea  a recent Division Bench Judgment dated 20-4-2010 passed in L.P.A. No.  859/2007 (State of Bihar and others Vrs. Sanjay Kumar and others)  was relied upon    and lastly, assailing the   views expressed in the  judgment of the learned Single Judge under appeal it was submitted that                                     311     Rule 11 of the Rules can co-exist with the earlier administrative decision  dated 18-12-89 and therefore the learned Single Judge should not have  denied relief to the appellants on the basis of aforesaid rule 11 of the  Rules. Besides the aforesaid submissions on merit, it was strenuously  urged in the alternative that even if the appellants case is not accepted  on merits, no recovery should be made of the alleged excess salary  because the excess payment was not made on account of any  misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the appellants nor it was on  account of any malafide or dishonest act by any of the appellants. For  this purpose reliance was placed upon several judgments of the Supreme  Court including that in the case of Syed Abdul Qadir Vrs. The State of  Bihar, (2009 ) 3 SCC 475.  19.       Mr. Tej Bahadur Singh, learned counsel appearing for some of  the appellants claimed for relief on the principle of equal pay for equal  work and also pleaded for restraining the respondents from making any  recovery in view of law laid down by the Apex Court .  20.       Mr. Manik Vedsen, learned counsel for some of the appellants  adopted a technical plea that the learned single judge could not have  relied upon Rules of      1991, in support of impugned order dated  16-1-2001 because such a plea is not incorporated in that order. For this  he relied upon    the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of  Mohinder     Singh Gill Vrs. The Chief Election Commissioner and  others reported in A.I.R.1978 SC 851. He also pleaded against recovery  on the ground that higher scale was allowed by the Government itself  and such action was not without jurisdiction. Lastly, he placed reliance                                     312     upon the doctrine of legitimate expectations on the basis of provisions  in Rule 11 of the Rules. His submission is that under the rules the  untrained     Matric scale to untrained teachers was a short term and  temporary phenomena because the Government was required to provide  for in-service training and opportunity to complete the training; it had  the duty to hold the required examination within a reasonable time so  that only those who could not succeed may suffer the lower pay-scale or  even the prospect of losing their service. According to him since the  Government failed to provide the infrastructure of in-service training  along with the required examination for a long period, the appellants  should not be made to suffer and this court should hold that the  appellants' deprivation of matric trained scale for period prior to result  of training on 20.6.2005 is illegal and arbitrary and should order the  State Government to provide them the Matric trained scale at least from  expiry of two years time fixed by the Apex Court in the case of Ram  Vijay Kumar and others Vrs. State of Bihar and others ( supra).  According to Mr. Vedsen, Rule 11 of the Rules contains a complete  scheme and the State Government must relax the rigours of Sub-rules  (1 ) and (2) of that Rules on the ground of its un-workability due to  failure of the State Government in providing in- service training and  examination for long years.  21.         On behalf of some of the appellants Mr. Vinod Kanth, learned  Senior Counsel also advanced the argument that the Executive decision  dated 18-12-89 being within the jurisdiction of the State Government by  virtue of Article 162 of the Constitution of India should be given equal                                     313     force as the Rules of 1991 framed under Article 309 of the Constitution  of India. According to him, the provisions in respect of pay-scale to  untrained teachers prescribed in 1989 decision and subsequently in the  Rules can co-exist. Secondly, he submitted that in the light of law laid  down by a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the case of  Purushottam Lal Vrs. Union of India ( AIR 1973 SC 1088), the non-  implementation of the report of FAC in respect of elementary school  teachers, while it has been implemented in respect of other services,  would be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. He  also pleaded that the State Government should not be allowed to make  any recovery of the alleged excess payment and lastly he supported the  plea that Rule 11 of the Rules is required to be relaxed by the State  Government in order to do justice to the appellants.  22.       On behalf of the State, learned Advocate General countered the  submissions of Mr. Rajendra Prasad Singh alleging unfair and arbitrary  classification so as to deprive the appellants of matric trained scale, by  placing reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of  National Textile Corporation ( M.P.) Ltd. Vrs. M.R. Jadhav ( 2008) 7  SCC 31. That judgment clearly shows that while considering a dispute  over pay-scale raised by plus two teachers from State of Bihar, the Apex  Court found ample justification in creation of two classes, one of trained  teachers and the other of untrained teachers, for grant of different pay-  scales.     After laying down the law clearly in paragraph-32 of the  judgment in the aforesaid case, the Apex Court however, did not deprive  the affected teachers of the benefit of higher pay-scale in view of                                     314     peculiar facts noted in paragraph-42 of that judgment. These included  the existence of similar agreement between the teachers' representatives  and the State Government as is available in the present case. Such  agreement was made before the dispute was referred to the F.A.C.  23.       We have no difficulty in accepting the submission advanced on  behalf of the State that classifying teachers as trained and untrained for  grant of two different scales cannot be termed arbitrary or unreasonable  and such action will not violate either Article 14 or          16 of the  Constitution of India. Once they can be treated as two classes, the plea of  equal pay for equal work must also fail. The other submission advanced  for showing the arbitrariness on account of decision by the Jharkhand  State is also found to be of no substance because action of the State of  Bihar must be judged on its own merit and not on the touch stone of an  executive decision taken by a neighbouring       State. As a policy, the  State of Jharkhand opted to accept the recommendations of F.A.C.  whereas when this court disposed of these writ petitions at the first  instance by ordering      for action in accordance with those very  recommendations, the State of Bihar joined some others, particularly  untrained Intermediate teachers in challenging that decision by the  learned single judge leading to remand and fresh decision by the order  under appeal. As a principle of law, it cannot be held that the State of  Bihar must act as per wisdom of another State. However, the fact  remains     that similar appointees of 1994 who were untrained but  graduates have been granted       matric trained scale in the State of  Jharkhand from a much earlier date.                                    315 24.        The submission based upon the written agreement between  the representatives of teachers and the State Government while referring  the dispute to F.A.C. requires some deeper consideration because as  noticed above, by a recent decision, a Division Bench of this Court in  L.P.A. No. 859/07 disposed of on 20-4-2010 held that the State  Government having made particular representation to its employees on  which they called off their strike and when such representation was  reduced to an agreement in writing,     cannot be allowed to back out  from its representation and promise.  25.       In reply, learned Advocate General sought to raise a plea that  the F.A.C. was required to make recommendations within the terms of  reference applicable to the Fitment Committee as and when its  recommendations fell for consideration by the F.A.C. In effect, the  submission is that an unacceptable recommendation of F.A.C. can be  ignored by the State Government on the grounds permissible in law,  such as on account of limitations flowing from terms of reference or on  account of recommendation being violative of Rules or law or the  Constitution. Fortunately, we are not required to examine this aspect  further because as noticed earlier the recommendations of F.A.C. in  respect of elementary school teachers have neither been accepted nor  rejected by the State Government and even before such decision could  be taken, the recommendations were incorporated in the judgment  rendered earlier in this case on 14-9-2001 and     were ordered to be  implemented. But now after remand the learned single judge has taken a  different view and has not found those recommendations acceptable on                                     316     account of rule 11 of the Rules. In such circumstances, this court is not  called upon to test the legality of any decision of the State Government  as such decision has been pre-empted by judgment of this Court. In  such circumstances, the agreement between the employees and the State  Government cannot be of much significance. Here it may be usefully  noted that when the learned Single Judge ordered for implementation of  the recommendations of the F.A.C. such decision was challenged by  some of the appellants, the State Government as well as by  representatives of teachers. This conduct shows that not only the State  Government but the other parties, the representatives of the teachers  have also chosen to avoid that agreement. The reason lies in the facts  that the recommendations allowed the claim of only graduate untrained  teachers but not that of Intermediate untrained teachers.       In such a  situation, when the earlier Division Bench permitted the teachers and  their representatives to challenge the decision of the learned single judge  adopting recommendations of F.A.C, it will not be proper or in the  interest of justice to hold both the parties bound by the agreement made  on 7-5-1999 at the time of referring the issues raised by the agitating  employees to the FAC.  26.       The two main issues which are now required to be discussed  are as follows :- (i) Whether it is permissible for the State Government  to accept the demand of the appellants and grant the reliefs in the teeth  of provisions in rule 11 of the Rules and (ii) whether the provisions of  rule 11 had    become unworkable         leading to great hardship to the  untrained teachers like the appellants and therefore the State should be                                        317     directed to relax the said rule as a one time measure and take a decision  for shifting the date of grant of matric trained scale to any earlier date  because of unusual delay in holding the examination of training and  publication of result in June 2005.  27.           Rule 11 of the rules has already been extracted and noticed  earlier.   The wordings of the entire scheme in that rule are clearly  mandatory and do not permit any deviation through an administrative  decision by the State. In the matter of grant of scale while appointing  untrained teachers under the Rules framed under Article 309 of the  Constitution, the State Government had no scope to obliterate the  qualification between trained teachers and untrained teachers. They had  to be appointed and placed in two different scales and the untrained  teachers can get the other higher scale only on fulfilling the conditions  prescribed in rule 11 i.e., only on passing the training examination.  Earlier executive decision of 1989 may exist in respect of earlier  appointees but that cannot be applied to those elementary teachers who  were appointed after the framing of the rules of 1991. For such later  appointees like the appellants the Rules under Article 309 of the  Constitution alone shall hold the field, particularly when the provisions  in Rule 11 are found to be mandatory. Rules under Article 309 of the  Constitution have legislative flavour and executive decision in the light  of power available to the State under Article 162 of the Constitution  cannot supplant the Rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution.  On facts, it is found that decision of 1989 do not supplement the Rules  rather they clearly run counter to such rules. Hence, for the teachers                                       318     appointed after enforcement of 1991 Rules, the decision of 1989 cannot  co-exist in the matter of appointment in the scales prescribed by the  Rules.  28.             Such later appointees have to be granted pay-scales as  determined by the Government from time to time in accordance with  rule 11 of the Rules. So far agreement requiring acceptance of  recommendations of FAC is concerned, there can be no quarrel with the  proposition of law that there can be no estoppel against statute. Further,  a writ court can not issue mandamus against provisions in the Rules  which do not suffer from any legal infirmity. The judgment of Apex  court in the case of Purushottam Lal Vrs. Union of India (supra) was  in an entirely different fact situation     and related to grievance by  members within a particular service. It has no application in the facts of  the present case.  29.                 In view of aforesaid discussions and findings, we find  ourselves in agreement with the views of the learned single judge that  grant of lower scale of pay to untrained teachers is in conformity with  rule 11 of the Rules and is also based on sound reasons. Hence, it is not  possible to issue a writ of mandamus to implement the recommendations  of the FAC. Grant of matric trained scale to untrained teachers cannot  be directed by this Court, particularly due to provisions in the Rules. In  that view of the matter the Apex Court also in the case of Ram Vijay  Kumar and others Vrs. State of Bihar and others (supra) directed only  for completing the training of untrained teachers within two years.                                     319 30.         Coming to the last issue, we find merit in the submission  advanced on behalf of the appellants that due to inability of the State  Government to hold the required examination within a reasonable time,  the appellants who were successful, have suffered undue hardship. In  that view of the matter, when the examination could not be held within  two years in spite of directions of the Apex Court and even later, as per  directions of this Court, we are of the view that the State Government  which has the necessary powers, must take steps to relax rule 11 of the  Rules as a one time measure within a reasonable time and take a prompt  decision to grant matric trained scale to the teachers who have passed the  in-service training examination in June,2005 from any date which may  be found suitable and reasonable so as not to affect such teachers  adversely for the unusual delay in holding the training examination. It  would be reasonable and appropriate to grant matric trained scale to such  teachers as indicated above from any reasonable date, may be from the  date when the period of two years fixed by the Apex Court for  completing the training of such teachers expired without compliance or  even from 1-10-2003, i.e. when actual payment in Matric trained scale  was stopped. Keeping in view the requirements of Article 14 of the  constitution, benefit of advancing the date for grant of Matric trained  scale, as indicated above will also be made available to such teachers  who may pass the training examination in the second attempt. For them  the date will vary but benefit should be on same lines as given to those  who have passed in the first attempt.                                         320 31.          We, accordingly direct the respondents to take appropriate  decision in the light of observations and directions indicated above  within three months from today.  32.          We have no hesitation in holding that in the light of law laid  down by the Supreme Court and by this Court, no recovery shall be  made of the alleged excess payment made to the untrained teachers on  account of payment to them in matric trained scale. In the present case  the excess payment was made by the authorities on account of wrong  interpretation or ignorance of rule 11 of the Rules and the employees  concerned had no means of knowing that they were getting payment by  mistake. On that principle, as enunciated in the case of Syed Abdul  Qadir Vrs. The State of Bihar (supra), we restrain the respondents from  making any recovery from the appellants. It is made clear that this order  shall be applied by the respondents in case of appellants as well as all  other similarly situated teachers appointed as untrained teachers     after  coming into force of 1991 Rules.  33.       The appeals are accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent.  There shall be no order as to costs.                                          (Shiva Kirti Singh, J.)

His mother was from rural northern Peru while his father grew up closer to large Peruvian cities.[3] He began rapping at age 12 and later started making beats and writing songs with a friend at the Museum of Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2010, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a songwriter and producer.[1]  Career[edit] A.CHAL released his debut EP, Ballroom Riots, in 2013. The album found some success, which he parlayed into a publishing deal with Sony ATV.[1][3] He then spent two years out of the public spotlight before beginning to release a variety of singles in 2015.[1][5] One of those singles, ""Round Whippin'"", was debuted online on The Fader and then followed up with a world premiere on Zane Lowe's Beats1 channel and supported on OVO Sound Radio.[5][6][8] As a result of this publicity, A.CHAL was named one of Pigeons & Planes best new artists of 2015.[7] He also performed at the Interview Magazine event during Coachella that year.[1][2] In February 2015, he released the single ""GAZI"", which he co-produced with Count Justice.[1] In September 2015, A.CHAL released another a single, ""Vibe W/U"", which was first publicized by A$AP Rocky on Twitter.[5][6][8] In 2016, A.CHAL performed at the Day N Nite Fest.[4] He also released a few more singles before self-releasing his debut studio album, Welcome to GAZI, in June 2016.[3][6] He has since premiered the official music video for ""Round Whippin'"" with Complex.com[9] and been featured on tracks by Ro James,[10] Stwo,[11] and Tess.[12] In March 2018, A.CHAL signed with Epic Records.[13]  Musical style[edit] A.CHAL's music generally fits into the hip hop and R&B genres. USA Today has described his music as falling somewhere ""in the negative space between Hip-Hop, R&B, chillwave, and pop music.""[8] A.CHAL himself has described his music's genre as soul.[3] His sound has also been characterized as ""sedated"", ""hazy"", and ""almost-psychedelic"".[1][7][14] Remezcla has called his voice ""sultry, sparse, and desperate"".[1] Lyrically, he largely discusses anecdotal experiences. Writing about his 2016 album Welcome to GAZI, Jules Muir of Pigeons & Planes noted that A.CHAL attempts to cut ""to the core of many of society's ills and triumphs by tapping into a deep well of personal experiences and anecdotes.""[5]  Discography[edit] Studio albums[edit]  List of albums   Title  Details   Welcome to Gazi   Release: June 3, 2016 Label: GAZI World/Empire Format: Digital download, streaming   On Gaz   Release: June 2, 2017 Label: GAZI World/Empire Format: Digital download, streaming  EPs[edit] Ballroom Riots (2013) Exotigaz (2018) Singles[edit] As lead artist[edit]   Title  Year  Peak chart positions  Album   USR&BAirplay[15]  USLatinPop[16]  USRapAirplay[17]  USRhy.[18]   ""Round Whippin'""  2016  — — — —  Welcome to Gazi   ""To the Light""  2017  — — — —  On Gaz   ""Matrix""  — — — —   ""Love N Hennessy""(solo or featuring 2 Chainz and Nicky Jam)  50 — 24 20   ""Perdóname""  — — — —   ""Cuánto""(featuring A$AP Nast)  — — — —   ""000000""  2019  — 40 — 28  Exotigaz   ""—"" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.

Definition: Electronic Payments Made Easy          Share        Pin        Email            •••  Jac Depczyk / Getty Images        By Justin Pritchard           Updated May 13, 2019     In banking, ACH stands for Automated Clearing House, which is a network that coordinates electronic payments and automated money transfers.     ACH is a way to move money between banks without using paper checks, wire transfers, credit card networks, or cash.     References to ACH can mean several things, depending on where you see it.     On bank statements (or in your transaction history), ACH means that an electronic payment was made to or from your account using your checking account information. Common examples of ACH transfers appear below. For any ACH transfer to move funds to or from your account, you need to authorize those transfers and provide your bank account and routing numbers.     On your bills, ACH means you have the option to pay your bills electronically. Other terms include eChecks, EFT, or AutoPay. Instead of writing a check or entering a credit card number every time you pay, you can provide your checking account details and pay directly from your account. In some cases, you control when payment takes place (the funds only move when you request a payment). In other cases, your biller automatically pulls funds from your account when your bill is due, so you need to be sure you have funds available in your account.       What Does ACH Mean?    What, exactly, does Automated Clearing House refer to? A definition of the terms might help:     Automated: The ACH system consists of computers working together to process payments automatically. There’s no need to manually handle payments (on your part or the biller’s). ACH is a “batch” processing system that handles millions of payments at the end of the day.Clearing house: The network uses two central “clearing houses.” All requests run through either The Federal Reserve or The Clearing House. This allows for efficient matching and processing among numerous financial institutions.       Examples of ACH Transactions    You probably have more experience with ACH than you think. Individuals and businesses use ACH for everyday transactions such as:     Direct deposit of your wages (from your employer to your bank account)Automatic payment of recurring bills such as energy bills, insurance premiums, and Homeowners Association (HOA) dues. When you provide a voided check to your biller, you’re setting up ACH.Payments from businesses to vendors and suppliersMoving money from your brick-and-mortar bank to your online bank     As with any technology, using ACH means embracing the pros and cons. Let’s review those below.      Pros  FOR CUSTOMERS: Get paid faster with an automated payment, and without waiting for a check to clear Automating bill payments to avoid late fees and missed payments Making online purchases without having to use a credit card or check Minimize paper records that carry sensitive banking information FOR BUSINESSES: Makes money transfers easy with minimal labor and cost Allows employee payments without printing checks, stuffing envelopes or paying for postage Facilitates regular customer payments without having to transport actual paper checks to the bank Has lower fees than credit card payments Electronic process makes vendor and supplier payments easier and faster, while keeping electronic records of all transactions    Cons  FOR CUSTOMERS: Companies have direct access to your bank account Auto payments are deducted whether or not you have the funds in your account, which can trigger overdraft fees FOR BUSINESSES: Allows other companies to have a direct link to your bank account Customers can reverse their payments, although not as easily as with a credit card Must monitor the transactions for fraud, as business accounts have fewer protections than consumer accounts Companies may need to buy software and invest in training to process ACH payments         What Does ACH Do for Consumers?    If you’re an individual, you may enjoy:     Getting paid by your employer quickly, safely, and reliably. There’s no need to wait for your paycheck to arrive or to deposit the check at your bank.Automating your payments, so you never forget to pay (and your payments arrive on time)Making purchases online without using a check or credit card. You pay quickly and avoid credit card processing fees.Minimizing the number of pieces of paper floating around with your bank account information     The main drawback for consumers is that setting up ACH provides businesses with direct access to your checking account. They take the money to pay your bills whether you’re ready to pay or not. If you’re short on funds, you might prefer to pay a different way. Alternatively, you might want to prioritize when you have limited funds and pay only the most important bills first.     For more details on how consumers use ACH, read about setting up ACH debit.       What Does ACH Do for Businesses?    If you run a business, you benefit from:     A low-cost, non-labor-intensive way to transfer moneyPaying employees without the need to print checks or pay postageGetting paid by customers easily, quickly, and regularly—no more cash-flow crunches dependent on when you can get to the bankProcessing fees that are lower than credit card swipe feesGetting paid by vendors—or paying suppliers—in a way that’s easy to track and safe (there’s an instant electronic record of everything)     Businesses face the same problem as consumers: There’s a direct link to your checking account, and any errors or unexpected withdrawals can cause problems. What’s more, businesses need to be careful of customers reversing charges and taking back payment. That said, it’s harder to reverse an ACH payment than it is to reverse a credit card payment.     Businesses need to be especially vigilant about monitoring for fraud. Consumers enjoy a high degree of protection against errors and fraud in their checking accounts, but business accounts do not have the same level of protection. If funds leave your account, it may be your responsibility to recover the funds (or take the loss).     Finally, businesses may need to purchase software or invest time and resources into transitioning to ACH transfers. However, they’ll most likely more than recoup those costs over the long run.     For more details on how businesses use ACH, read about ACH processing.       Computers That Talk    The ACH system is a network of computers that communicate with each other to make payments happen. There are two sets of computers for each payment:     The side that creates a requestThe side that satisfies the request (assuming all goes well, which is usually does)     ODFI: Using direct deposit as an example, an employer (through the employer’s bank) creates a request to send money to an employee’s account. The employer is known as the Originator, and the employer’s bank is the Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI). That request goes to an ACH Operator, which is a clearinghouse that gets numerous requests throughout the day, and which routes the request to their destination.     RDFI: The receiving financial institution is the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI), which will adjust the account of the final accountholder—the employee receiving pay in this case—who is known as the Receiver.       Types of Transactions    ACH transactions come in two forms:     Direct deposits are payments to a receiver, such as wages from your employer or Social Security benefits paid into your checking account.Direct Payments are requests to pull funds from an account. For example, direct payments happen when you pay utility bills automatically from your checking account.     Transactions (currently) don’t happen in real-time. Instead, banks use “batch processing” and process the entire day’s worth of requests at once. As a result, you don’t get paid immediately after your employer authorizes payment. Instead, the transaction takes one or two business days to move through the system. There are plans to speed up ACH payments, and same-day payments have already begun for selected transactions.

J1939 Overview J1939 is set of SAE standards commonly used in diesel-powered applications for communication and diagnostics between application components.  The J1939 standard is defined in multiple documents corresponding to five of the seven OSI layers.  J1939-11 defines the physical layer, J1939-21 defines the data link and transport layer, J1939-31 defines the network layer, and J1939-71/73 defines the application layer.  J1939-81 describes network management.  The goal of this document is not to explain all these standards in detail.  For this, please consult the SAE standards.  Instead, we will look at the construction and transmission of messages as defined by J1939-21 using NI-CAN and supported hardware.   Back to Top 2. J1939 Message Construction J1939 messages are built on top of CAN 2.0b and make specific use of extended frames.  Extended frames use a 29-bit identifier instead of the common 11-bit identifier.  J1939-21 defines fields within this 29-bit identifier as shown below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 1. J1939 29-bit Identifier Fields The first three bits are the priority field.  This field sets the message’s priority on the network and helps ensure messages with higher importance are sent/received before lower priority messages.  Zero is the highest priority. The next bit is reserved for future use.  This field should be set to zero. The next bit is the Data Page field.  This is used to expand the maximum number of possible messages.  The next eight bits make up the Protocol Data Unit Format (PDU F) field.  This is used to determine if the message is intended for a specific device on the network or if the message is intended for the entire network.  If the value of PDU F is less than 240, the message is meant for a specific device.  If the value is 240 or greater, the message is intended for all devices. The next eight bits make up the Protocol Data Unit Specific (PDU S) field.  The definition of this field is based on value of the PDU F field.  If PDU F is intended for a specific device (less than 239), PDU S is interpreted as the address of that specific device.  In this case, the PDU S field is referred to as the Destination Address field.  This format is referred to as PDU 1.  If PDU F is intended for all devices (greater than or equal to 240), PDU S is interpreted as a Group Extension field.  This group extension is used to increase the number of possible broadcast messages.  This format is referred to as a PDU 2. Both formats are described below in picture form.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 2. PDU 1 Format  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 3. PDU 2 Format The last eight bits identify the address of the device that transmitted the current message.  This is known as the Source Address Field.  On standard CAN networks, identifiers are used to uniquely define each message.  This concept exists within J1939 as well.  Because the priority and source address fields can change, they are not used for this purpose.  This leaves the reserve, data page, PDU F and PDU S fields.  This new combination of fields is referred to as the Parameter Group Number (PGN).  Each message in J1939 must have its own unique PGN.  The J1939-71 standard is responsible for assigning these unique PGNs to standard messages.  Back to Top 3. Addressing Each device on the network has to have a unique address ranging from 0 to 254.  These addresses are mainly used for PDU 1 messages and requests.  In most cases, these addresses are static and pre-defined by the user.  However, the J1939-81 standard does define a method of dynamic addressing.  Back to Top 4. Special Messages Although J1939 uses the PDU F field mainly to specify if the message is PDU 1 or PDU 2, there are a few special values set aside for features like requests, dynamic addressing, and transport protocol.  These values override the greater than/less than rules for PDU 1 and PDU 2 formats.  Requests are used as an example below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 4. Request PGN Notice in this example that PDU Format is set to 234.  Normally, this would be handled as a PDU 1.  However, because this is a special message, the device knows to handle the message differently.  In this specific case, it knows it has to respond to the originator of the request in a particular format as defined by the J1939-21 standard.    Back to Top 5. Transport Protocol The J1939 standard allows single messages to have more than eight bytes of data, however, the CAN specification only supports eight byte data transfers.  Therefore, the message must be sent in multiple packets.  J1939-21 defines how to package, send and reassemble these messages within the constraints of the CAN specification.  J1939-21 calls this transport protocol and specifies two types  The first is Broadcast Announcement Message (BAM) which is similar to PDU 2 in that it is intended for the entire network.  The second is called Connection Mode and is similar to PDU 1 in that it is intended for a specific device. Both transports protocols work in a similar fashion.  They use two special messages to facilitate these multi-packet transfers.  The first is known as a Transport Protocol Connection Management message (TP.CM).  The data in a TP.CM message contains connection commands (also called Control Byte), the PGN identifier of the multi-packet message and information about how to reconstruct the message.  The second is called a Transport Protocol Data Transfer message (TP.DT).  The data of a TP.DT message contains a sequence number in the first byte and uses the remaining seven bytes for the data of the multi-packet message.  Back to Top 6. BAM Messages As mentioned above, Broadcast Announcement Messages are intended for the entire network.  Therefore, no handshaking with other devices is required.  The originating device first sends a TP.CM message with a control byte BAM (32).  Next the originator starts sending all the data through the TP.DT messages until all the data has been sent.  Below is an example to show the flow of a BAM message.  Here, PGN 65260 is 20 bytes and is being transferred via BAM in 3 TP.DT packets.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 5. BAM Data Transfer Example    Back to Top 7. Connection Mode Messages Connection Mode is a peer to peer transfer.  Therefore, handshaking and message acknowledgements are used to guarantee successful data transfer.  First, the originating devices sends a TP.CM message with a control byte Request to Send (16).  This is the originator asking the receiver if it is capable of receiving data.  The receiver can then respond in various ways but normally it is with a TP.CM message containing control byte Clear to Send (17).  The data of the TP.CM Clear to Send message contains the current sequence number to transfer as well as the number of TP.DT packets allowed.  The originator then sends TP.DT messages starting at the sequence requested and stops after reaching the number of TP.DT messages allowed.  This process continues until all the data is transferred.  The receiving device then has to send a TP.CM message with control byte EndofMsgACK (19) confirming that all the data was successfully received.  Here is an example to illustrate a typical Connection Mode message.  Here PGN 65259 is a 27 byte message requiring 4 TP.DT messages.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 6. Connection Mode Data Transfer Example Note:  It is acceptable to send a TP.CM Clear to Send message indicating that zero packets can be transferred.  This doesn’t mean the connection is invalid.  Instead it means the receiving device isn’t ready for the data.  It is also acceptable to send a TP.CM Clear to Send message with a sequence number that has already been sent.  This is often used when the receiver thinks the previous TP.DT messages were corrupt.  Back to Top 8. NI-CAN Reference Example Overview This example is named J1939 NI CAN Frame Example.vi and it is located in the Examples\NI CAN Frame Example folder.  It uses NI PCI/PXI CAN hardware and the NI CAN Frame API to show an implementation of reading and writing transport protocol messages.  The example code abstracts the packetization, transmission and reconstruction of these messages from the user such that there is no difference in the reading/writing of messages greater than eight bytes and messages of eight bytes or less.      Back to Top 9. NI-CAN Reference Example Front Panel The front panel of this example contains four sections and is pictured below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 7. J1939 NI CAN Frame Example Front Panel The first is labeled Setup.  In this section, the user can select the NI-CAN port, set the baud rate (J1939 is typically 250k) and set the device address.  These setting need to be entered before running the example.   The next section is labeled Control and Monitoring.  This section is used for stopping the VI and viewing any errors that occur.   To the right of these sections is the Output section.  Once the program is running, this section is used to send messages.  The user enters the appropriate information into the Data to Send cluster and selects Send Message?.  The Data array can be more than eight bytes.  If it is, the VI will automatically transfer the message over the network using the correct transport protocol type, abstracting any difference between eight byte (or less) messages and messages greater than eight bytes.  This will be discussed in more detail below.   The last section is labeled Input.  This contains the CAN Frame cluster.  This cluster is where new incoming messages are displayed.  This does not include messages like requests, address claims, and transport protocol messages.  It only includes data messages.  If a data message is greater than eight bytes and is transferred over transport protocol, it will be reconstructed in software (discussed below).  Once this reconstruction occurs, the message will be displayed like any other standard message.  Back to Top 10. NI-CAN Reference Example Block Diagram The block diagram of this example can be broken into four sections.  These sections are Initialization, Writing Messages, Reading Messages, and Code Cleanup. Initialization Initialization in this example consists of configuring the CAN port, opening the CAN port, and initializing our J1939 code.  For the J1939 specific code, this means creating multiple queue references, clearing any previously used memory and setting the current device address.  Figure 8. J1939 NI CAN Frame Example Initialization Writing Messages The writing messages section contains three loops.  These loops are discussed below. Cmd Loop The first loop is the Cmd Loop and it is pictured below.    Figure 9. Cmd Loop This loop is controlled from the front panel.  When the button Send Message? is selected, Data to Send is placed on the Process Outgoing queue to be read in the second loop (discussed below).  To the user, this is all you have to do to output a message.  The example will automatically use the correct transport protocol if a message over eight bytes is sent.  If you want to output messages from anywhere else in the program, the process is the same.  Simply queue that message on Process Outgoing and the example program will take care of the rest. Process Outgoing Messages Loop The second loop is called Process Outgoing Messages and is picture below.  Figure 10. Process Outgoing Messages Loop This loop contains two J1939 VIs.  The first is called J1939 Process Outgoing Messages.  This VI first reads all messages off the Process Outgoing queue.  Then, it determines if the message is eight bytes or less.  If it is, it queues the message to the third loop (discussed below).  However, if the message is greater than eight bytes, the VI determines if the message requires BAM or Connection Mode to transfer.  It then opens the appropriate transport protocol connection locally and queues the messages necessary to open that connection on the network to the third loop. The second VI is called J1939 Check Outgoing TP Timeouts.  It is responsible for checking if any of the open transport protocol connections are able to transfer data packets (TP.DT messages).  If any of these packets can be transferred, they are queued to the third loop. Output Processed Outgoing Messages Loop The third loop is named Output Processed Outgoing Messages and is pictured below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 11. Output Processed Outgoing Messages Loop This loop simply reads any messages on the queue from the second loop and outputs them on the CAN port.  This queue is named Processed Outgoing. Reading Messages The reading messages section contains two loops.  These loops are discussed below. Process Incoming Messages Loop The first loop is called Process Incoming Messages and is pictured below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 12. Process Incoming Messages Loop This loop first checks if there are any messages on the CAN port.  If messages exist, those messages are read and passed to a VI called J1939 Process Incoming Messages.  This VI processes one CAN Frame at a time.  It first filters out any messages that aren't intended for the device.  Then, if the message is intended for the device, it determines the message type.  If the message is a standard PDU 1 or PDU 2 message, it is queued to the second loop (discussed below).   In the case that the message is a transport protocol message, it determines if the message is for a message being generated or received by the device and handles it appropriately.  It also waits until all messages are received and reassembled for a specific PGN before queuing the completed message to the second loop.  The user will never see any of the transport protocol messages, just the finished message. For other special messages, like requests, address claiming, etc. there are just stubs that don't currently do anything.  These stubs could be implemented such that more J1939 features are available but that will be the responsibility of the user and outside of the scope of this example.   Read Processed Incoming Messages The second loop is called Read Processed Incoming Messages and is pictured below.  Figure 13. Read Processed Incoming Messages Loop The loop returns completed messages.  Every message will be in the same format, even if the message was received via a form of transport protocol.  The only difference is the data will be over eight bytes.  From here, you can process the message. Code Cleanup In this example, the last thing we do is close the NI-CAN reference.  No clean up is necessary for the J1939 code.  This section is pictured below.  Figure 14 J1939 NI CAN Frame Example Code Clean Up  Back to Top 11. cRIO Reference Example Overview This example is named J1939 cRIO Example.vi.  It shows how to implement the reading and writing of transport protocol messages on CompactRIO.  This example functions in the same way as the NI-CAN example discussed above.  There are no difference in terms of the J1939 specific code.  However, there are some differences between the examples at the top level due to the different platforms being used.  These differences are discussed below. Note: To open this VI, first open the project named J1939 cRIO Example Project.lvproj that resides in the Examples\cRIO FPGA Example folder.  Once the project is open, expand the RT CompactRIO Target inside and double click on the J1939 cRIO Example VI.  Back to Top 12. cRIO Reference Example Project The targeting of a CompactRIO requires the use of the LabVIEW Project.  Our project is called J1939 cRIO Example Project and is pictured below.     Figure 15.  J1939 cRIO Example Project The project contains configuration information about our CompactRIO.  This includes information like IP address, FPGA target type and IO modules.  Note the NI 9853 High Speed CAN module in slot 1 of our FPGA Target.  This is what we are using to read and write our CAN Messages. Also, notice that there are two VIs in this project.  One is under the RT CompactRIO Target and is called J1939 cRIO Example.vi.  This is our top level VI.  The other VI is under FPGA Target and is called J1939 cRIO Example_FPGA Main.  This VI is responsible for reading and writing CAN messages.  It is started and controlled by our top level VI.   Last, take notice of the two DMA channels named CAN Outgoing and CAN Incoming.  These two channels are used to transfer CAN messages between the cRIO and FPGA programs.    Back to Top 13. cRIO Reference Example Front Panel The front panel of the cRIO reference example is the same in function as the NI-CAN example above.  The only difference is that the baud rate and CAN Port aren't available as setup parameters.  These parameters have to be set using the LabVIEW project.  By default, this example uses port 0 of a NI 9853 in slot 1 with a 250k baud rate.  Please consult your module documentation and LabVIEW help for more details on setting these parameters.  Back to Top 14. cRIO Reference Example Block Diagrams The block diagram can be broken into the same four sections as the NI-CAN example.  Only the differences will be discussed.  For additional information, please review the sections above. Initialization The differences in the cRIO example initialization section are hardware specific only.  Instead of initializing our NI-CAN hardware and Frame API, we initialize and start our FPGA VI (J1939 cRIO Example_FPGA Main).  This is pictured below.  Figure 16 J1939 cRIO Example Initialization Writing Messages The writing of messages happens on the FPGA Target when using a CompactRIO.  This requires two VIs, one running on the FPGA and one running on the CompactRIO controller.  It also requires a mechanism for transferring data between these two VIs.  These are discussed below. CompactRIO Code Writing messages on the CompactRIO has three loops just as the NI CAN example above.  The only loop that is different is the Output Processed Outgoing Messages Loop displayed below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 17. Output Processed Outgoing Messages Loop This loop still reads from the Processed Outgoing queue but instead of outputting a CAN message to the NI CAN Frame driver, it writes it to a DMA FIFO called CAN Outgoing.  This DMA FIFO sends the data to the VI running on the FPGA. FPGA Code In the FPGA code, there is a loop called Write to CAN Module Loop, pictured below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 18. Write to CAN Module Loop This loop reads from the DMA FIFO and constructs a CAN Message.  It then sends this message to the CAN Port. Reading Messages Reading messages with the CompactRIO example are broken into two pieces.  One piece runs on the CompactRIO controller and the other runs on the FPGA Target.  These are discussed below. FPGA Code When we read a CAN message on CompactRIO, we actually need to start with the FPGA code.  The FPGA VI contains a second loop called Read CAN Module Loop and it is pictured below.    Figure 19. Read CAN Module Loop In this loop, we check for any new messages.  If none are available, we timeout and do nothing.  If messages are available, we send the data into the DMA FIFO named CAN Incoming.  This sends the message up to the host. CompactRIO Code On the CompactRIO side, we read any new messages sent on CAN Incoming in the Process Incoming Messages Loop, shown below.  [+] Enlarge Image Figure 20. Process Incoming Messages Loop When a message is received, we format it to a standard CAN cluster and pass it to the J1939 Process Incoming Messages.vi.  At this point, this loop is exactly the same as the NI CAN Frame example above. The rest of the code for reading messages is the same as described above. Code Cleanup The only difference is the code cleanup section is that we close the FPGA reference instead of the NI-CAN reference.  Figure 21. J1939 cRIO Example Code Clean Up  Back to Top 15. NI-XNET Example Overview This example is named J1939 NI-XNET Frame Example.vi and it is located at Examples\NI-XNET Frame Example folder. It uses NI-XNET PCI/PXI CAN hardware and the NI-XNET API to show an implementation of reading and writing transport protocol messages.  The example code abstracts the packetization, transmission and reconstruction of these messages from the user such that there is no difference in the reading/writing of messages greater than eight bytes and messages of eight bytes or less.    Back to Top 16. NI-XNET Example Front Panel The front panel of the NI-XNET reference example is the same in function as the NI-CAN example above.   The only difference is the frame cluster uses the NI-XNET CAN frame cluster instead of the NI-CAN frame cluster.  The other difference is that the CAN port can be selected with an IO Control.  The IO control automatically detects which CAN ports are available on your system.  Back to Top 17. NI-XNET Example Block Diagram The NI-XNET example is very similar to the NI-CAN example, so we will only show the main differences here. Initialization Initialization in this example consists of creating an NI-XNET input stream session using IO Control from the front panel to select the CAN port.  The input stream session will enable us to read every frame off the bus.  We also need to set the baudrate for our session.  We also initialize our J1939 code.  For the J1939 specific code, this means creating multiple queue references, clearing any previously used memory and setting the current device address.  Figure 22. NI-XNET Example Initialization Writing Messages The only difference in the NI-XNET Example (from the NI-CAN example) is how we actually output the messages on the bus, using the Output Processed Outgoing Messages Loop.  Output Processed Outgoing Messages Loop In this loop, we convert the frames from the J1939 format to the NI-XNET frame format and write them to the bus.  Figure 23. NI-XNET Output Processed Outgoing Messages Loop Reading Messages Process Incoming Messages Loop This loop first checks if there are any messages on the CAN port.  If messages exist, those messages are read and passed to a VI called J1939 Process Incoming Messages.  This is very similar to the NI-CAN version.   Figure 24.

There’s a reason we don’t have webbed feet or nut-cracking beaks like other species, and that’s because we don’t need them. The system isn’t perfect, of course. If you ever wind up having painful abdominal surgery, odds are pretty fair that it will be your good-for-nothing appendix that’s to blame. And wisdom teeth seem a lot less wise when you consider how often they fall down on the job and need to get yanked. As it turns out, the same why-bother pointlessness is true of what you might consider one of your loveliest features: your chin.     The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample    Sign Up Now     Researchers have long wondered what the adaptive purpose of the chin could possibly be. Sexual selection seems like an obvious answer, since an attractive chin increases your chances of mating. But a feature needs a function before it can appear in the first place. Only then can it be assigned some aesthetic value.   The other, better answer is all about chewing. The jaw exerts enormous forces when it bites and chews—up to 70 lbs. per sq. in. (32 kg per 6.5 sq. cm) for the molars. Conscious clenching increases the figure, and people who grind their teeth in their sleep may exceed the average force 10-fold. What’s more, the jaw moves in more than just one axis, both chewing up and down and grinding side to side. That, so the thinking went, might increase bone mass in the same way physical exercise builds muscle mass. And bone mass, in turn, may produce the chin. The problem with the theory, however, is that it doesn’t account for Neanderthals and other primates—including the great apes—which lack prominent chins but in many cases have far more powerful bites than we do. To answer the riddle, Nathan Holton, a post-doctoral researcher who specializes in craniofacial structure in the University of Iowa school of orthodontics, selected 37 of the many subjects whose facial measurements have been taken regularly from age 3 to young adulthood, as past of the longstanding Iowa Facial Growth Study (yes, there is such a thing).        With the help of basic physics, it’s possible to determine how much force any one jaw exerts without the subjects’ ever having to be tested directly with a bite gauge. Measuring the geometry of what orthodontic researchers call the mandibular symphysis and what everyone else just calls the chin region, and comparing that to what is known as the bending moment arm—or the distance between where a force is initially applied (in this case the muscles in the jaw) and where that force is eventually felt (the chin)—yields a pretty good measure of force exerted. “Think about removing the lug nuts from a wheel on your car,” Holton wrote in an e-mail to TIME. “The longer the wrench, the easier it is because the longer wrench increases the moment arm, allowing you to create more force.”   And more force, in this case, should mean more bone mass in the chin—but that’s not what the results of the new research showed. Not only did the two turn out to be unrelated in the 37 subjects studied, but Holton and his colleagues even found that as the face matures, the chin is less adept at resisting mechanical forces, which is the whole reason it was assumed to grow more pronounced in the first place. So why did we grow chins at all? The answer is, we didn’t. Holton and his collaborator, University of Iowa anthropologist Robert Franciscus, instead suspect that the face shrank away from behind the chin as primitive and pre-humans became modern humans, making it appear larger relative to everything else. The reason, as with so many things in the human species, has to do with male behavior—specifically violent male behavior. As humans migrated from Africa 20,000 years ago and settled down into societies, males had to become less competitive and more cooperative—giving an advantage to those with lower testosterone levels. And reduced testosterone softens and shrinks the craniofacial structure.   “What we are arguing is that modern humans had an advantage at some point to have a well-connected social network,” Franciscus said in a statement accompanying the study. “And for that to happen, males had to tolerate each other. There had to be more curiosity and inquisitiveness than aggression, and the evidence of that lies in facial architecture.” It wasn’t until we had our chins that we set about assigning value to them—strong ones, weak ones, angular, round, cleft or dimpled, depending on your tastes. Those tastes—and the mating choices that arise from them—ensure that the chin will stay. It might be biomechanically useless, but you’d look awfully silly without one.

We all know the feeling of drawing a perfect face only to ruin everything with a weak chin. We find ourselves asking ""why is something so simple so difficult to draw?"". To most people, it may seem like a simple task, but take a closer look at this facial keystone and you'll notice it's not as simple as the layman would think. Is it a half circle? A triangle? A parabolic curve? The truth is, the chin is none of those things, but with a little practice, you too can get it right every time.           Steps         1  Do your research. Look at every possible resource for chin reference: online images, your reflection, your friends and family, pictures of presidents on coins. After a few months, you'll notice something interesting - all chins are different, and yet, fundamentally the same. Anatomically, the chin is mostly defined by the human mandible. This bone structure is what gives the chin it's sharp, royal angles. It is less hindered by fleshy muscles or soft tissue, unless the recipient is overweight of course.           2  Practice drawing the rest of the face. You won't be able to tell if your chin looks right if it's situated on an anatomically incorrect face right? Try taking some online classes or going to live drawing sessions and work on every part of the face other than the chin. Once you can draw soulful eyes, tender lips, and sterling cheekbones you are ready to begin drawing the most powerful feature of the face.          3  Decide what kind of chin you want to draw. For instance, feminine chins are generally smaller and sharper whereas masculine chins are larger and more boxy. Making this decision is critical as it will completely determine the personality of your drawing.          4  Draw the sides of the chin. Once you've decided the sort of chin you want to draw, begin drawing the sides of the chin. Keeping in mind that chins are like cornerstones holding together the cheeks of the face, make sure the angle of the sides of the chin match up to sides of the face. This is important or else your chin may look like it belongs elsewhere!          5  Draw the bottom of the chin. This is the most difficult part of the entire chin - it may be tempting to connect the sides of the chin with a single horizontal line or to extend the sides down into a point, but these techniques will make your chin look amateur at best. Begin at the left side and slowly descend in the south-east direction as if you are gently caressing the bottom of a magnet. Continue on your path eastwards, leveling out as you reach the meridian of the face, and finally finish with a gentle slope upwards as you reach your destination on the right side of the face. Look back and admire your chin - congratulations! You've drawn a perfect human chin!

Drawing a perfect chin is no small task, and very few people can get it right on the very first try. Ask for criticism! If you're not sure if your chin is quite there, ask your mother, your aunt, your little sister, and see what they think. Don't be afraid of accepting criticism, just because someone doesn't like your chin doesn't mean they are a hater. Only draw one chin per face. Doing more than one can result in a creepy, Cronenbergish end result. Of course if that is your intent, then by all means have several chins! Overweight people may have what is known as a ""double-chin"". In this case, simply draw a larger, softer chin underneath the first one.       Made Recently       Loading...

J. College of ArchitectureOccupationArchitectAwardsPadma ShriPracticeKanvinde, Rai and ChowdhuryBuildingsIndian Institute of Technology Kanpur   PK Kelkar Library, IIT Kanpur, designed by Achyut Kanvinde Achyut Purushottam Kanvinde (1916–28 December 2002) was an Indian architect who worked in functionalist approaches with elements of Brutalist architecture. He received the Padma Shri in 1974.[1]  Contents  1 Early life and education 2 Career 3 Philosophy 4 Design concepts 5 References 6 External links   Early life and education[edit] He was born in Achare, in the Konkan region of Maharashtra, in 1916 in a large family. His mother died when he was two and his father was an arts teacher in Mumbai. Kanvinde, influenced by his father, a portrait and landscape painter, took up art and graduated in architecture from Sir J.J. School of Arts, Mumbai in 1942. He was then sent by the Government of India to study at Harvard  where he worked under Walter Gropius and was influenced by his thinking and teaching.The European masters of the Bauhaus – Albert Bayer, Moholy Nagy, Marcel Breuer, and the Swiss-American architectural historian Siegfried Giedion also had a great impact. Some of his famous batchmates were Paul Rudolph, I. M. Pei and John Perkins.  Career[edit] When he returned to India he joined the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1985, he was the winner of the IIA ""Baburao Mhatre Gold Medal"".[2]   The University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore campus designed by Kanvinde and Rai Along with his partner Shaukat Rai, he opened the firm Kanvinde, Rai and Chowdhury in New Delhi (which is currently run by Sanjay Kanvinde, B.K. Tanuja and  Murad Chowdhury). The firm has been responsible for IIT Kanpur, National Science Centre, Delhi, The National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in New Delhi,  NII Pune,  numerous dairy buildings under NDDB and many other buildings.[3]  Philosophy[edit] Kanvinde played with space and forms. A famous example is the ISKCON Temple at New Delhi. He gave great importance to natural light. The form of the building is such that the problem of ventilation as well as excessive heat is beautifully solved. He championed the cause of vernacular architecture. He believed  that values and historical influences contributed towards good architecture.[citation needed] ""Over the years I have come to believe it is imperative that an architect develop a sensitivity to human nature and a respect for human values. This, after all, is at the very core of his work. In India the search for a new architectural expression must continue – and this must go beyond the satisfaction of matter of fact functional needs. I think the designer’s sensibility here must become aware of the accumulated wisdom of generations, but this should go together with the idea of progress reflected in the evolution of technology. In my own case, I must acknowledge my tremendous debt to Gropius – it was he who really exposed me to the power of technology on the one hand and the psychological dimensions of spatial organisation on the other. Actually my present concerns and realisations are all reflections of my earlier preoccupations: as a student at the J. J.

Solar Frontier modules meet global certification standards like IEC, JET, UL, and California Energy Commission standards. Solar Frontier’s unique CIS technology uses zero cadmium, is lead-free, and has no special recycling requirements. At the Atsugi Research Centre (ARC) in Japan, Solar Frontier continues pushing their proprietary CIS technology to the next level by improving module performance.   CIS modules have a unique light soaking effect on initial exposure to sunlight, which allows for higher output than factory spec. This has been proven by field data from around the world. Compared to polycrystalline silicon technology, global field data show consistently higher output ratio (kWh/kWp) for CIS modules – that is, our panels produce more energy for every kilowatt-peak you install. It is the combination of properties embodied in CIS technology that makes it so special. It offers the best possible solution for generating the highest possible energy yields – even under the most difficult of circumstances. Hence, when you opt for Solar Frontier modules you get the four-fold benefit – good low light behaviour, high shadow tolerance, high temperature stability, the light soaking effect – higher yields (kWh) under all conditions.    CIS Solar Frontier modules have high temperature stability. This means your installations work at their optimum even during high summer or in warmer regions. Modules that are exposed to an ambient temperature of 30 °C can reach surface temperatures as high as 70 °C. Hence, temperature stability of CIS is a great advantage, and reflected in energy production 10% higher than crystalline modules. In all photovoltaic modules, output diminishes as temperatures rise, which results in yield losses. This is why the performance of conventional technologies is considerably lower in the summer months or in hot regions, in spite of high irradiation values. Temperature has less effect on Solar Frontier’s CIS modules than on crystalline silicon modules, which means Solar Frontier modules have higher temperature stability. This is reflected in a lower temperature coefficient of the output, which is usually indicated on the datasheet as a percentage per degree Kelvin.   In real life conditions, installations often get partially covered by shadow or there may be cloudy and low-light conditions. Solar Frontier CIS modules show a more stable power output than crystalline silicon panels due to high shadow tolerance quality. Combined with light soaking effect – a chemical reaction that increases the rated power output when placed under the sun – CIS modules generate more kilowatt-hours per kilowatt-peak installed, the key to financial success of any project. Solar Frontier’s modules have been installed in a wide range of climates, from northern Germany and Japan and India to near the equator, on office buildings, commercial complexes, institutions etc. HIGH SHADOW TOLERANCE Highest yields – even in the shade. Thanks to their high shadow tolerance, Solar Frontier modules are efficient even when shadows are cast over the modules or their surfaces are partly covered. The reason for this can be found in the different cellular structure. The square silicon cells in the module are connected in substrings. On the other hand, the long, very narrow thin-film cells are connected in series. The entire c-Si module stops working as soon as a small area, a single cell, for example, is covered or shadowed. In contrast, the CIS module continues working, only the covered or shaded area stops producing energy. The results are higher yields even in the shade. This has the advantage that some shadowing is acceptable in designing the system, in order to achieve the highest yields. If defined shadows are to be expected, (for example: horizontal shadows in the morning or evening cast by a shed roof, or in a field system), then energy production can be optimized: in this case, the CIS modules must be installed with the cell perpendicular to the cast of the shadow. If shadowing of a module or a module row of x% occurs, there is still energy production of 100-X%. The cell structure of the modules and the associated shadow tolerance has the added advantage that the distance between module rows can be reduced in free-field installations and on industrial flat rooftops, so more generating power, expressed in Watt-peak, can fit in a given area.

We create memories that last a lifetime. Every nook and corner harbors stories that make our home uniquely ours. Each one of us therefore, deserves a home that reflects our dre​ams and our ambitions. For ourselves and for our loved ones.   Home Finance therefore, is a vital step towards realising this dream. Our team will work with you to customise a solution that is just right for your need. Whether it is financing a new home, home extension, home improvement, home construction or even purchasing a plot of land before building your home.     ​Home Loans  KNOW MORE    Home Extension Loan  KNOW MORE    Home Improvement Loan  KNOW MORE    Plot & Home Construction Loan  KNOW MORE    Home Construction Loan  KNOW MORE        A sudden requirement of funds is an unavoidable circumstance arising in professional or personal life. Whether a personal necessity (hospitalisation, child's marriage) or a professional one (expanding business operations on a priority basis), every person requires immediate financial backing at key moments. In this context, it is imperative to consider an invaluable alternative source of finance known as Loan Against Property (LAP). This is a loan borrowed by placing one's owned property as collateral. The funding may be given by financial institutions after scrutinising the validity of the said property and its current market value.
