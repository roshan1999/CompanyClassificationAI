# Company Classification Algorithm 
---
The objective of this algorithm is to segregate banking sectors and companies into its corresponding categories. 
The major categories detected by this algorithm include 
1. Bank
2. Insurance
3. Investor
4. Mutual Fund
5. Loans and different type of loans, 
etc...
The algorithm has been trained in 2 ways, the first is using unsupervised learning, and supervised learning. 
## Part 1
Unsupervised Learning - 
The major algorithm I thought of using was Kmeans clustering.
While implementing the same i read on clustering algorithms and tried using it.
## Part 2
I later realized that using unsupervised learning and focusing on data sets to enhance the input to the 
classifier algorithm was important. 
To run the python file
1. Clone the link to your desktop
2. Find the pythonFile named Comp_Classify_final into your local machine
3. Open the terminal / Command shell and type in the following commands
----
    - python comp_classify/Final.py
The above should allow you to determine the sector that the company belongs to.
